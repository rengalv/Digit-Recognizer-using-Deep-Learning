# Digit Recognizer using Deep-Learning

## Introduction:

This a hobby project that I have been working on once I completed the [Deep Learning using Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/deep-learning-in-python) course on Datacamp. It was a great course with a lot of insights starting from what is a neural network to how to interpret the various concepts in *Deep learning.

## Pre-requisites:

It would be ideal to have access to the following tools:

* Python 3.0
* Jupyter Notebook: I am a huge fan of using Python Notebooks and so would recommend installing the Jupyter Notebook 
* Basic Programming skills
* Some Linear Algebra: To understand the matric representations and implementations

## Methods:

I had experimented various techniques in the course of the project that would cover the following list of techniques associated to Deep Learning:

* Feature Scaling 
* Activation Functions: Softmax, ReLu
* Number of Hidden Layers
* Cost function for misclassification
* Adam Optimizer to converge the beta estimates in the model

## Conclusion:

At the end I was able to implementation of Digit recognizer using the Keras package with Tensorflow in the back end in Pyhton. I was able to get an accuracy of **0.9816** in identifying the digits in the images.
