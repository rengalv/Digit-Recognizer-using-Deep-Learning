# Digit-Recognizer-using-Deep-Learning

## Introduction:

This a hobby ptojrct that I have been working on once I completed the [Deep Learning using Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/deep-learning-in-python) course on Datacamp. It was a great course with a lot of insights starting from what is a neural network to how to interpret the various concepts in 'Deep learning'.

Implementation of Digit recognizer using the Keras package with Tensorflow in the back end. We get an accuracy of 0.9816.
